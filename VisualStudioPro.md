### Lizenzmodell

**[Lizenzportal](https://my.visualstudio.com/)

**User Licensing**
All Visual Studio subscriptions and Visual Studio Professional are licensed on a per-user basis. Each
licensed user may install and use the software on any number of devices to design, develop, test, and
demonstrate their programs. Visual Studio subscriptions also allow the licensed user to evaluate the
software and to simulate customer environments to diagnose issues related to your programs. Each
additional person who uses the software in this way must also have a license.

**Where the Software can be Installed and Run**
The licensed user can install and use the software on any number of devices. The software can be
installed and used on your devices at work, at home, at school, and even on devices at a customer’s office
or on dedicated hardware hosted by a 3rd party. Most subscriber software can also be run in Azure VMs.
However, the software is otherwise not licensed for use in production environments.
A production environment is defined as an environment that is accessed by end users of an application
(such as an Internet Web site) and that is used for more than Acceptance Testing of that application or
Feedback. Some scenarios that constitute production environments include:
• Environments that connect to a production database.
• Environments that support disaster-recovery or backup for a production environment.
• Environments that are used for production at least some of the time, such a server that is rotated
into production during peak periods of activity.

**Reassignment of the License**
The Visual Studio subscription or Visual Studio Professional standalone license can be reassigned to
another user—such as when a person leaves the team—but not within 90 days of the last assignment for
purchases through retail and Volume Licensing channels.
